# Hello World!
I'm Nikhil Shekokar, a Computer Engineer and a Data Science enthusiast, besides that I teach school kids Math and Science as a part of my hobby.
This is my first project on Github and I'm sure that whoever is reading this will take a look and add on your contribution to make it more even better.
It's built up using Python with OpenCV library and also DNN (Deep Neural Networks).
Hope to seek you concern.
Thankyou!
